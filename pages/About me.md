## Programming Experience
After graduating from college, I found myself fascinated by programming. In my spare time, I started to learn MIT 6.00.1. A lovely professor gave me a chance to get a glimpse into the world of computer language. For a deeper understanding, I studied CS61A. This course taught me recursion, function, class, and how to divide a problem into pieces and implement them abstractly. Having done those interesting homework and projects gave me sufficient confidence and curiosity, so I turned to study Nand2tetris. This course tells what is inside a computer. Even the simplest computers are complex to build. I paid plenty of effort trying to make everything works fine. After finishing this, I started to learn CS61B and Algorithms. They taught me fundamental data structure, algorithms, Java syntax, and how to solve unfamiliar problems. I know I still have a long way to go, but I am delighted in the process of learning. Although sometimes I get anxious, I believe the only certainty is that life is uncertain.
